<i>Because sometimes $\large{\color{#fff8d7}{vanilla}}$ needs a little $\large{\color{#d2691e}{spice}}$</i>.

The goal of this skill tree mod is to provide a relatively well rounded levelling experience that provides a fair amount of progression, whilst remaining fair and relatively vanilla-friendly.

This skill tree is suited for:
- [x] People who want more out of their minecraft
- [x] Players who want to choose their skills depending on their playstyles
- [x] Players who want a balanced experience where strong abilities also come with really impacting downsides
- [x] Multiplayer!

This is a vanilla++ Fabric-only skill tree that satisfies most people who want more of 1.20.1 Minecraft without adding anything that detracts from the original experience.
